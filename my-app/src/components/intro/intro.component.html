            This website is dedicated to one of the rarest modern BMWs ever produced:
            the <strong>BMW F11 550i Touring LCI</strong> equipped with the
            <strong>N63B44TÜ</strong> engine. Based on information I received from a
            trusted source, only around <span class="numbers">222 left-hand drive</span>
            and <span class="numbers">25 right-hand drive</span> cars were built —
            making this model a true hidden gem in BMW’s history.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you own one, know of one, or can contribute data about an individual car,
            this registry aims to collect and preserve the history of every known example.
            Entries include (when available): chassis number, build date, specification,
            ownership history, location, and supporting photos.
